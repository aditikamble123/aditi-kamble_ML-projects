# 📊 Smart Loan Recovery System

The Smart Loan Recovery System is a Machine Learning-based analytics solution designed to predict loan repayment outcomes and assist financial institutions in identifying high-risk borrowers.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project performs:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Classification model building to predict repayment
- Custom scoring logic to prioritize loan recovery efforts
- Visualizations for decision support

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Project Structure
- `Smart Loan Recovery System.ipynb` — Full project notebook with all steps
- Data cleaning, visualization, model building and evaluation in one place

## 📈 Key Highlights
- Trained multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Evaluated accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Implemented recovery scoring logic to rank borrowers
- Interpreted feature importances and risk profiles

## 🧠 Learnings
- Model evaluation tradeoffs in high-stakes finance
- Feature engineering for tabular financial data
- How to translate ML outputs into actionable business logic

## ✅ Results
✔️ Achieved model accuracy of 88.57% using Random Forest Classifier
✔️ Obtained high precision and recall for the "Fully Paid" class, making it reliable for identifying safe loans
✔️ Developed a Recovery Scoring System to prioritize borrowers based on probability of default
✔️ Visualized class distributions, feature importances, and confusion matrices to support actionable insights

## 📎 Future Improvements
- Deploy as a Streamlit app or dashboard
- Integrate with real-time CRM data
- Experiment with ensemble models or XGBoost
