# 🗳️ Election Spending Analysis

This project analyzes election spending patterns using a Jupyter Notebook. It aims to uncover trends and insights from political campaign expenditures, such as top spenders, category-wise distribution, and temporal patterns.

---

## 📚 Contents

- `Election_Spending.ipynb`: The main notebook with data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 📈 Spending Trends and Aggregates
- 📅 Time Series and Category-wise Breakdown (if applicable)
- 📌 Conclusions and Recommendations

---

## 🔧 Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
numpy
jupyter
````

Install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy notebook
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the notebook.
2. Open a terminal and run:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open `Election_Spending.ipynb` from the Jupyter interface.

## 🧠 Insights (Add some of your findings here)

* Example: The majority of spending occurred during the last 2 weeks of the campaign.
* Example: Candidate X had the highest media budget.
* Example: Transportation and logistics were the largest non-media expenses.

## 📌 Future Work

* Integrate data from more election years or regions.
* Use ML models to predict spending outcomes.
* Deploy the analysis as an interactive dashboard.
