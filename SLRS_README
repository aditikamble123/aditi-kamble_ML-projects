# 📊 Smart Loan Recovery System

The Smart Loan Recovery System is a Machine Learning-based analytics solution designed to predict loan repayment outcomes and assist financial institutions in identifying high-risk borrowers.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project performs:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Classification model building to predict repayment
- Custom scoring logic to prioritize loan recovery efforts
- Visualizations for decision support

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Project Structure
